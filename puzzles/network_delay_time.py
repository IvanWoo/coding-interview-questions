"""
You are given a network of n nodes, labeled from 1 to n. You are also given times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (ui, vi, wi), where ui is the source node, vi is the target node, and wi is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.

We will send a signal from a given node k. Return the time it takes for all the n nodes to receive the signal. If it is impossible for all the n nodes to receive the signal, return -1.

Example 1:
Input: times = [[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], n = 4, k = 2
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 1
Output: 1

Example 3:
Input: times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 2
Output: -1
 
Constraints:
1 <= k <= n <= 100
1 <= times.length <= 6000
times[i].length == 3
1 <= ui, vi <= n
ui != vi
0 <= wi <= 100
All the pairs (ui, vi) are unique. (i.e., no multiple edges.)
